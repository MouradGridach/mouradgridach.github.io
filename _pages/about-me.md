## Short Biography

Hi! My name is Mourad Gridach. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. Previously, I was visiting fellow at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford working with Professor Irina Voiculescu on biomedical image segmentation. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Colorado working with Professor Larry Hunter. I am a Professor of computer science focusing especially on Artifiical Intelligence and Applied Mathematics from Agadir, Morocco.

I have completed my BSc degree in computer science  at the Faculty of Science, Fez (FSF). I did my Master of science studies at the High Institute of Techology in Fez (HITF) in computer science (honours).

I got my PhD at the Faculty of Science Fez where I specialized in Computational Linguistics where I developed a Morphological Analyzer with my supervisor Mr. Noureddine Chenfour.

Now I’m working on computational linguistics, mainly focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER), Sentiment Analysis (SA), and other field of NLP. I am also interested in Computer Vision. 

I would say that Marvin Lee Minsky from MIT was the influencial person of my whole life. I almost watched all his talks and lectures and read most of his works. Every time I don't feel good or I lost concentration, I watch one of his talks and Ouuupa I feel better. I was planning to visit him at MIT last summer, but unfortunately He died early that year in January :( 2016.
