I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. Previosuly, I was an Africa-Oxford Visiting Fellow at Oxford University working with Doctor Irina Voiculescu on biomedical image segmentation. Also, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Colorado working with Professor Larry Hunter. My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.

My main area of research is Medical Imaging specifically Medical Image Segmentation and Multi Modal Deep Learning for Biomedical Image Analysis. Furthermore, I worked on Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for classical texts as well as biomedical texts, Sentiment Analysis (SA), and other field of NLP.
