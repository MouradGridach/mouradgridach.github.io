Hi! My name is Mourad Gridach, and I am a Senior AI Scientist at IQVIA. I am part of the Advanced NLP team led by Jay Nanavati, within the Applied AI Science group based in Cambridge, UK. Previously, I worked as a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, under the supervision of Professor Alison Julia Noble. During this time, I was a member of the PULSE (Perception Ultrasound by Learning Sonographer Experience) team, an ambitious interdisciplinary research project. PULSE explores the use of artificial intelligence-based technologies to reduce the need for highly trained ultrasound operators by applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to real-world ultrasound videos, eye-tracking, and probe movement data.

Additionally, I was a visiting fellow at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, working with Professor Irina Voiculescu on biomedical image segmentation. During this fellowship, I developed innovative machine learning algorithms to refine MRI segmentation techniques, specifically focusing on identifying the femur bone within hip MRI scans. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Colorado, where I worked with Professor Larry Hunter.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the Faculty of Science in Fez (FSF), and I completed my MSc in Computer Science (with honors) at the High Institute of Technology in Fez (HITF). I earned my PhD from the Faculty of Science in Fez, specializing in Computational Linguistics under the supervision of Professor Noureddine Chenfour. My PhD work involved developing a Morphological Analyzer.

I am deeply inspired by Marvin Lee Minsky from MIT, whose work has been a guiding influence in my life. His talks and writings have had a profound impact on me. Whenever I feel unfocused or demotivated, watching his lectures reinvigorates me. I had hoped to visit him at MIT, but unfortunately, he passed away in January 2016, before I had the chance.
